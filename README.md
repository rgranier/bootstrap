## Issues/Questions?
Changing caps on the directory in Atom doesn't seem to have an effect.  Windows issue?
When working in Atom, you get a error message indicating if the current commit is behind the remote (you forgot to pull or someone else make a change while you were working).   Does this occur in Git Bash?
