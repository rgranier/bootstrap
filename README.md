# Bootstrap Working Repository

Bootstrap Repo (edit on server).

## Issues/Questions?
Changing caps on the directory in Atom doesn't seem to have an effect.  Windows issue?
When working in Atom, you get a error message indicating if the current commit is behind the remote (you forgot to pull or someone else make a change while you were working).   Does this occur in Git Bash?  

### Scenario

- Changes made to the remote and changes made locally (both committed).  
- Got an error when attempted to push to the remote without doing a pull first.
- Did the pull, there were no conflicts.  Saw the changes made on the remote.

**Message indicating that "Merge branch master."**
_This must have been an automatic merge. We still have a push with a "2" waiting._
